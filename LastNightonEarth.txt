I text a post card sent to you
Did it go through?
Sendin' all my love to you

You are the moonlight of my life
Every night
Givin' all my love to you

My beatin' heart belongs to you

I walked for miles 'til i found you
I'm here to honor you
If i lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you

With every breath that i am worth
Here on Earth
I'm sendin' all my love to you

So of you dare to second-guess
You can rest
Assured that all my love's for you

I'm here to honor you
If i lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you
